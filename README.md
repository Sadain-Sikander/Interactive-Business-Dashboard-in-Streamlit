## Approach / Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Fixed column names (removed spaces & encoding issues)
   - Converted date columns to `datetime`
   - Ensured numeric columns are correct
   - Filled missing numeric values with 0
   - Dropped rows missing critical categorical information (`region`, `category`, `sub_category`, `customer_name`)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Checked data distribution
   - Calculated aggregated KPIs
   - Identified top 5 customers by sales  

3. **Dashboard Development**
   - Built with **Streamlit** for interactivity
   - Charts made with **Plotly Express**
   - Sidebar filters allow dynamic selection
   - KPIs and charts update automatically based on filters  

4. **Insights**
   - East region has the highest total sales
   - Certain product categories have high sales but lower profit → opportunity for cost optimization
   - Top customers contribute significantly to revenue → focus marketing efforts
